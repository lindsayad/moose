    requirement = 'The system shall be able to solve the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in 1D cylindrical coordinates, using a Rhie-Chow scheme, dirichlet boundary conditions for both variables, and demonstrate second order convergence for the velocity and first order convergence for the pressure.'
