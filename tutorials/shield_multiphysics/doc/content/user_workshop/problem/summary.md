## [#step01]

The first step is to solve a simple "Diffusion" problem, which requires no code. This step
will introduce the basic system of MOOSE.

!equation
-\nabla\cdot\nabla T = 0

!---

## [#step02]

In order to implement the heat conduction equation, a `Kernel` object is needed to represent:

!equation
-\nabla\cdot (k\nabla T) = 0

!---

## [#step03]

We represent the boundary conditions using `BC` objects. For example, Dirichlet boundary conditions:

!equation
T = 300 K

or Neumann boundary conditions

!equation
q = 30 W/m^2

!---

## [#step04]

Instead of passing constant parameters to the heat conduction `Kernel` object, the Material
system can be used to supply the values. This allows for properties that vary in space and time
as well as be coupled to variables in the simulation.

## [#step05]

The heat flux can be compute from the temperature as:

!equation
q = -k \nabla T

This velocity can be computed using the Auxiliary system.

## [#step06]

Solve the transient heat equation using the "heat transfer" module.

!equation
\rho c \frac{\partial T}{\partial t} - \nabla \cdot k \nabla T = 0

!---

## [#step07]

Solve the pressure, velocity and temperature in a coupled system of equations by solving for conjugate heat transfer
with the fluid region

!equation
\rho_c c_c \frac{\partial T_c}{\partial t} - \nabla \cdot k_c \nabla T_c = 0
\\
\nabla \cdot \vec{u} = 0
\\
\frac{\partial \rho_w  \vec{u}}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot \left(\rho_w \vec{u} \otimes \vec{u}\right)
= \nabla \cdot \left(\mu_{w,\text{eff}} \left(\nabla\vec{u}_I + \left(\nabla \vec{u}_I\right)^T-\frac{2}{3}\nabla\cdot\vec{u}_I\mathbb{I}\right)\right) -\nabla p + \rho_w \vec{g}
\\
\rho_w c_w \left( \frac{\partial T_w}{\partial t} + \vec{u}\cdot\nabla T_w \right) - \nabla\cdot k_w \nabla T_w = 0

## [#step08]

In the transient simulation, a "traveling wave" profile moves through the concrete as it heats up.
Adaptivity lets us resolve the temperature gradient at lower computational cost.

!---

## [#step09]

`Postprocessor` and `VectorPostprocessor` objects can be used to compute aggregate value(s) for a
simulation, such as the average temperature on the boundary or the temperatures along a line
within the solution domain.

!---

## [#step10]

Thermal expansion of the concrete can be added to the coupled set of equations
using the "tensor mechanics" module, without adding additional code.

!---

## [#step11]

MOOSE is capable of running multiple applications together and transfer data between the various
applications.

We artificially introduce local micro-structure calculations to compute material properties.

!---

## [#step12]

MOOSE includes a system to create custom input syntax for common tasks, in this step the syntax
for the sets of equations are simplified for end-users.
