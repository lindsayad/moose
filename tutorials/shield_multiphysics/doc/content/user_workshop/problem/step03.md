# Step 3: Boundary conditions id=step03

!---

Fixed temperatures at the boundary conditions are simple but not realistic. We want to have:

- a fixed heat flux from the micro-reactor inside the concrete cavity

- natural convection boundary conditions with the air around the shield

- convective boundary conditions with the water block

<!-- See index.md, the boundary conditions system is presented here -->

First, the sidesets must be added / present in the mesh.
We modified the meshing script to generate sidesets for our boundary conditions

Convective boundary conditions

We use the same boundary condition as for air for now. When we introduce a separate variable for the
water temperature, we will revisit this.

## Step 3: Run

Using the step 3 executable:

```bash
cd ~/projects/moose/tutorials/shield_multiphysics/step03_boundary_conditions
make -j 12 # use number of processors for your system
cd problems
../moose-opt -i step3.i
```

Using a prebuilt MOOSE from conda:

```
conda activate moose
moose-opt -i step3.i
```
